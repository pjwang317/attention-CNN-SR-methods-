    An implementation of the algorithm for calculating the Feature SIMilarity

    luminance component of images. For multichannel images, convert to
    grayscale first. Dynamic range should be 0-255.
    Parameters
    ----------
    img0 : array
    img1 : array
        Two images for comparison.
    nlevels : scalar
        The number of levels to measure quality.
    nwavelets : scalar
        The number of wavelets to use in the phase congruency calculation.
    Returns
    -------
    metrics : dict
        A dictionary with image quality information organized by scale.
        ``metric[scale] = (mean_quality, quality_map)``
